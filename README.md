The psychmeta package provides tools for computing bare-bones and psychometric meta-analyses and for generating psychometric data for use in meta-analysis simulations. Currently, the package supports bare-bones, individual-correction, and artifact-distribution methods for meta-analyzing correlations and d values. Please refer to the overview tutorial vignette for an introduction to psychmeta's functions and workflows.
